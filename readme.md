>You are on the hunt for interesting articles around the web, open 100 tabs and end up‚Ä¶ not reading them. Sounds familiar?

Summary Helper allows to summarize articles with a custom prompt - so it can be as tailored to your language, profession or point of view as you define it. The summary gets inserted in the content area itself. This way you can easily forward the artice including the generated summary to your Kindle device e.g. using [Reabbles Send-to-Kindle tool](https://send.reabble.com/).

## Overview

This project includes two components:
- **Chrome Extension**: A browser plugin for generating AI summaries of web content.
- **Bookmarklet Generator**: A tool for creating bookmarklets that provide AI summaries.

|  | Bookmarklet  | Browser Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Mistral AI | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Custom Prompt | üü† Initially set base prompt | ‚úÖ Base + custom prompt per request|
| Cross Platform | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå|


## Project Structure

- `chrome-extension/`: Contains the files for the Chrome extension.
- `bookmarklet-generator/`: Contains the files for the bookmarklet generator.
- `privacy.md`: Privacy policy for the project.

## Installation and Usage

### Chrome Extension

1. Navigate to the `chrome-extension` directory and follow the instructions in the `readme.md`.

### Bookmarklet Generator

1. Navigate to the `bookmarklet-generator` directory and follow the instructions in the `readme.md`.


## Feature Agenda üöÄ

Bookmarklet generator generally ships faster since it is faster to iterate on.

### Browser Plugin

### Bookmarklet Generator 
- [x] Save API Key in Browser
- [x] iOS compatibility 
- [x] Select dom element by clicking to make insertion-point be definable by user
- [x] Add status state
- [ ] Include update mechanism (make the bookmarklet check this repo for a newer script) 
- [ ] Support other providers (on-device? What are some local LLMs we could use for this / API through localhost?)

## Troubleshooting

### Configuring CORS for Ollama

If you want to use offline LLMs with this plugin you need to ensure that your Ollama-based applications can handle requests from different domains, you need to configure the CORS settings appropriately. Here‚Äôs how you can do it on different operating systems:

#### Windows

1. Ensure Ollama is not running by quitting the application from the taskbar.
2. Open the Control Panel and navigate to ‚ÄúEdit system environment variables.‚Äù
3. Choose to edit or create a new variable named `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`. To allow all domains, set it as follows:
   ```
   OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*
   ```
4. Apply the changes and close the control panel.
5. Run Ollama from a new terminal window to ensure it picks up the updated environment variables.

#### Linux

For Linux users running Ollama as a systemd service, follow these steps:

1. Use `systemctl edit ollama.service` to open the service file in an editor.
2. In the `[Service]` section, add the `Environment` line with your CORS settings. For unrestricted access, use:
   ```
   [Service]
   Environment="OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*"
   ```
3. Save your changes, then reload systemd and restart Ollama with:
   ```
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart ollama
   ```

These steps will help you configure Ollama to accept requests from all domains, ensuring seamless integration with your applications.
